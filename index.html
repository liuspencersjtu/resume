            <ul>
              <li>Enrich Zoom’s user experience by enhancing the real-time audio quality using ML/AI.</li>
              <li>Develop a CRNN model to detect sound events in audio recordings using PyTorch. Integrated the detected sound events into the
                audio processing flow, triggering corresponding modules such as aggressive noise reduction mode or AEC/AGC level control.</li>
              <li>Fine-tuned the model for improved accuracy and optimized it for lightweight, cross-platform implementation. Tested the model’s
                robustness to handle various meeting scenarios, such as far-field speaking, babble, high-reverb echo and noisy environments.</li>
              <li>Proposed a novel approach for using detected user behavior to provide audience feedback to hosts in zoom events.</li>
